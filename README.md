# Snowdonia Cheese project
Here is my submission for the Snowdonia Cheese website designed by e3creative. 
I chose to do the 'Desktop 3' layout, as I felt as though I could demonstrate more development knowledge with it's form-factor.

# Instructions
To clone the file\
	Run: `git clone https://github.com/iammatthewbirch1/SnowdoniaCheese.git`\
Delete the dist folder and then open command prompt on the file path and install the package dependencies\
	Run: `npm install`\
To build the project, and initialize browser-sync\
	Run: `gulp`\
This will open the project in a new tab but will not compile any file changes.\
\
To build the project without minifying the js so that you can debug and have browsersync refresh on change\
	Run: `gulp dev`\
